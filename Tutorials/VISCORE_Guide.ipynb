    "### VISCORE Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "In certain situations, it may be desirable to create an orthomosaic from a platform other than Metashape (e.g., VISCORE). The issue with this is that orthomosaic made from Metashape and that made with VISCORE are not aligned. This means that the labeled orthomosaic made from the VISCORE mosaic in TagLab will also not be aligned, making the back projection process fail. Therefore, an additional step consisting of aligning the VISCORE / labeled mosaic is needed to work with the existing workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the VISCORE mosaic into TagLab, label it, and export the Project JSON file, along with the labels as a PNG;\n",
    "2. Run the `combine_viscore_metashape.py` script to create a GeoTiff containing the VISCORE mosaic (bands 1, 2, 3) and labels (bands 4, 5, 6);\n",
    "3. Open ArcGIS and import the Metashape orthomosaic GeoTiff, and the combined VISCORE GeoTiff;\n",
    "4. Use the Georeferencing tool to georectify the combined VISORE mosaic (source), relative to the Metashape orthomosaic (target);\n",
    "5. Use the Extract Bands tool to extract bands 4, 5, and 6 from the georectified VISCORE mosaic as separate GeoTiff;\n",
    "6. Use the Raster Calculator tool to create an empty 3-band raster matching the dimensions of the Metashape mosaic;\n",
    "7. Use Band Mosaic tool to merge bands of the sepreated georectified VISCORE mosaic into the empty 3-band raster;\n",
    "8. Export the labeled Metashape mosaic as a PNG, with the same dimensions of the Metashape orthomosaic;\n",
    "9. Use this orthomosaic with the `back_project_metashape.py` script."

Open your Metashape project, click on `Tools`, and then `Scripts`. Navigate to the script in `Scripts/combined_rasters_metashape.py` and select it.
